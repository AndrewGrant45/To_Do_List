# To_Do_List Project
Created a to do-list utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I am a 2nd year Mechanical Engineering and Management Student at McMaster University with a passion for coding and programing. In the future, I hope to integrate my passion for coding and programing with my mechanical engineering endeavors. My goal is to build a strong understanding with the basics of coding and programming and this project will be a great introduction in HTML, CSS, and javascript.
